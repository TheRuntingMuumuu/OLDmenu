# Menu.bat
This is the repo for one of the first programs that I ever created. It was coded in windows batch, and I am very proud of the install mechanic. You only have to download one file and it will install the rest for you.

# How to use it
To use the program, just download the installer.bat, put it in a folder that you can writo to, and run it. It should download everything for you. If it does not for some reason, then you can use the program by running the STARTMENU.bat file in the Menu folder.

# Compatibility
It supports windows devices. It should support any versions with access to Windows Powershell and the internet. I have tested it recently on Windows 10, and I think that I tested on Windows 7 awhile ago but I cannot remember.
